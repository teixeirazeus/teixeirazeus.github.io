[{"content":"Introduction One of the most compelling aspects of functional programming is the concept of higher-order functions. In many scenarios, designing a function that generates other functions is an exceptional tool for refactoring and elevating our code\u0026rsquo;s abstraction level. This approach is a stepping stone towards metaprogramming — the idea of writing programs that generate programs.\nThough Python is not a purely functional programming language, it treats functions as first-class citizens. This means:\nFunctions can be assigned to variables. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. Functions can be returned from other functions. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into some illustrative examples:\nFunctions as Arguments Python is equipped with a functional programming library, and one of its common higher-order functions is the map function. The map function applies another function to all items in a given list. For instance:\ndef square(x): return x*x numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers)) print(squared_numbers) # [1, 4, 9, 16] In this example, map iterates over each item in the numbers list and applies the square function to each of them.\nFunctions Returning Functions This is where things get intriguing. Functions that return other functions allow for powerful and flexible patterns. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore:\nPower Function Factory Imagine you wish to create functions that raise numbers to various powers:\ndef power_factory(n): def nth_power(x): return x ** n return nth_power square = power_factory(2) cube = power_factory(3) print(square(4)) # 16 (4^2) print(cube(2)) # 8 (2^3) Here, power_factory returns a new function that raises its argument to the nth power. It\u0026rsquo;s a dynamic way to create different power functions.\nLogger Functions Functions that wrap around other functions to introduce logging functionality:\ndef logger(fn): def wrapped(*args, **kwargs): print(f\u0026#34;Calling {fn.__name__} with {args} and {kwargs}\u0026#34;) return fn(*args, **kwargs) return wrapped @logger def add(a, b): return a + b print(add(3, 4)) # Output: # Calling add with (3, 4) and {} # 7 The logger function enhances the add function to print its call signature before executing.\nShift Function Factory This creates functions that add a fixed value:\ndef shift_by(value): def shift_fn(x): return x + value return shift_fn shift_by_5 = shift_by(5) print(shift_by_5(3)) # 8 shift_by returns a new function that adds its argument to a pre-defined value.\nFunction Composition A function that takes two other functions and returns their composition:\ndef compose(f, g): return lambda x: f(g(x)) def double(x): return 2 * x def increment(x): return x + 1 double_then_increment = compose(increment, double) print(double_then_increment(5)) # 11 (2*5 + 1) Here, compose creates a new function that first doubles its argument and then adds 1.\nThese examples highlight the versatility and strength of functions returning other functions in Python. They can streamline our code, encapsulate specific logic patterns, and add dynamic behavior.\nCrafting a Lisp-Style Linked List in Python The functional programming paradigm, with Lisp at its heart, showcases distinct techniques and approaches. Among Lisp\u0026rsquo;s hallmark structures is the linked list, which diverges from the conventional ones seen in languages like Python or Java. In Lisp, each list adopts a recursive composition, bifurcated into car and cdr.\nThe first time I encountered this in the Lisp language, I was genuinely astounded. It felt as though I was instantiating lists out of thin air, relying solely on function definitions.\nUnderstanding car and cdr car: Originating from \u0026ldquo;Contents of Address Register\u0026rdquo;, it signifies the list\u0026rsquo;s first element. cdr (often pronounced \u0026lsquo;cudder\u0026rsquo;): An abbreviation for \u0026ldquo;Contents of Decrement Register\u0026rdquo;, it points to the list\u0026rsquo;s remainder. Simply put, a Lisp-style list is akin to Russian nesting dolls, where each car retains the value and the cdr encompasses the next nested pair.\nEmulating the List in Python We can mirror this structure in Python, leveraging higher-order and lambda functions.\n# Define the \u0026#39;pair\u0026#39; structure for our car and cdr def cons(x, y): def dispatch(m): if m == 0: return x elif m == 1: return y return dispatch # Extractors for car and cdr def car(z): return z(0) def cdr(z): return z(1) In this setup:\ncons initiates our pair, essentially crafting our list node. car extracts the leading element of our pair. cdr fetches the succeeding one. For constructing and exploring a Lisp-style list:\n# Constructing a list: (1, (2, (3, None))) my_list = cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, None))) To functionally print all elements:\ndef print_list(lst): if lst: print(car(lst)) print_list(cdr(lst)) print_list(my_list) # Output: # 1 # 2 # 3 What\u0026rsquo;s truly captivating about our Lisp-style list is its reliance on higher-order functions. Our cons function is designed to return another function (dispatch). This internal function carries the logic, deciding whether to offer the car or the cdr. Such abstraction makes list interactions smooth and exemplifies the magic of functions begetting functions.\nConclusion Higher-order functions possess immense power. Regrettably, they aren\u0026rsquo;t widely adopted across all programming arenas and are primarily confined to the realm of functional programming. This situation evokes a sentiment that we might be missing out on a vast potential by sidelining functional programming approaches.\nWorking with higher-order functions prompts us to think differently, allowing us to perceive beyond the immediate code. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, it serves as an enriching exercise in nurturing a functional mindset.\n","permalink":"https://teixeirazeus.github.io/blog/higher-order-functions-in-python/","summary":"Introduction One of the most compelling aspects of functional programming is the concept of higher-order functions.

The level has a default value of 1, a minimum value of 1, and a maximum of 100. The methods attribute is for adding methods to the schema; in our case, we\u0026rsquo;ll add the cry method.\nThe MongoDB collection will be named pokemon, and the schema is pokemonSchema.\nFor the database connection, using localhost with the database named pokemonDB:\nimport mongoose from \u0026#34;mongoose\u0026#34;; await mongoose.connect(\u0026#34;mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/pokemonDB\u0026#34;); Routes Route definition is similar to Express and Fastify.\nIts structure is .[method name](path, callback, hook?).\nExample of a GET route:\nnew Elysia() .get(\u0026#39;/ping\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;pong\u0026#39;) .listen(8000); We can also create route groups with prefixes:\napp.group(\u0026#39;/user\u0026#39;, app =\u0026gt; app .post(\u0026#39;/sign-in\u0026#39;, signIn) .post(\u0026#39;/sign-up\u0026#39;, signUp) .post(\u0026#39;/profile\u0026#39;, getProfile) ); Example with API versioning:\napp.group(\u0026#39;/v1\u0026#39;, app =\u0026gt; app .get(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Using v1\u0026#39;) .group(\u0026#39;/user\u0026#39;, app =\u0026gt; app .post(\u0026#39;/sign-in\u0026#39;, signIn) .post(\u0026#39;/sign-up\u0026#39;, signUp) .post(\u0026#39;/profile\u0026#39;, getProfile) ) ); Controllers To better organize the code, we\u0026rsquo;ll create a controller for Pokémon.\nCreate a file named pokemonController.ts:\nimport { Elysia, t } from \u0026#34;elysia\u0026#34;; import { Pokemon } from \u0026#34;./pokemonSchema\u0026#34;; export const pokemonController = new Elysia({ prefix: \u0026#34;/pokemon\u0026#34;, }).post( \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, async ({ body: { name, type, level } }) =\u0026gt; { const pokemon = new Pokemon({ name, type, level, }); await pokemon.save(); return pokemon; } ); The controller is a class that extends Elysia, and in the constructor, we pass the route prefix.\nThe POST is for creating a new Pokémon, and the body is the request body, which will be destructured to get the attributes: name, type, and level.\nThe function\u0026rsquo;s return is the created Pokémon.\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Pikachu\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Electric\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;: 10, \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;65243bedf7093d6df73bd300\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;__v\u0026#34;: 0 } To use the controller in index.ts, import the controller and add it to the app.\nimport { Elysia } from \u0026#34;elysia\u0026#34;; import mongoose from \u0026#34;mongoose\u0026#34;; import { pokemonController } from \u0026#34;./pokemonController\u0026#34;; await mongoose.connect(\u0026#34;mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/pokemonDB\u0026#34;); const app = new Elysia() .use(pokemonController) .get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Okey dokey\u0026#34;) .listen(8000); console.log( `🦊 Elysia is running at ${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}` ); Local Schema Elysia comes with a schema validation feature; to define the schema, import t. Example:\nimport { Elysia, t } from \u0026#39;elysia\u0026#39; new Elysia() .post(\u0026#39;/mirror\u0026#39;, ({ body }) =\u0026gt; body, { body: t.Object({ username: t.String(), password: t.String() }) }) Adding the schema to the controller:\nimport { Elysia, t } from \u0026#34;elysia\u0026#34;; import { Pokemon } from \u0026#34;./pokemonSchema\u0026#34;; export const pokemonController = new Elysia({ prefix: \u0026#34;/pokemon\u0026#34;, }).post( \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, async ({ body: { name, type, level } }) =\u0026gt; { const pokemon = new Pokemon({ name, type, level, }); await pokemon.save(); return pokemon; }, { body: t.Object({ name: t.String({ minLength: 1, }), type: t.String({ minLength: 1, }), level: t.Integer({ minimum: 1, maximum: 100, }), }), } ); Now, Elysia validates our request body and returns an error if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the schema.\nInvalid body, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: Required property Expected: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;: 1 } Found: {} Path Params Now, we need to access a specific Pokémon; for this, we\u0026rsquo;ll use path params.\nExample:\nimport { Elysia } from \u0026#39;elysia\u0026#39; new Elysia() .get(\u0026#39;/id/:id\u0026#39;, ({ params: { id } }) =\u0026gt; id) .get(\u0026#39;/rest/*\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Rest\u0026#39;) .listen(8080) Applying to our project, we\u0026rsquo;ll create a GET and UPDATE for the Pokémon.\n.get(\u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, async ({ params: { id } }) =\u0026gt; { const pokemon = await Pokemon.findById(id); if (!pokemon) { throw new Error(\u0026#34;Pokemon not found\u0026#34;); } return pokemon; }) .put( \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, async ({ params: { id }, body: { name, type, level } }) =\u0026gt; { let pokemon = await Pokemon.findById(id); if (!pokemon) { throw new Error(\u0026#34;Pokemon not found\u0026#34;); } pokemon.name = name; pokemon.type = type; pokemon.level = level; await pokemon.save(); return pokemon; }, { body: t.Object({ name: t.String({ minLength: 1, }), type: t.String({ minLength: 1, }), level: t.Integer({ minimum: 1, maximum: 100, }), }), } ); And finally, the Pokémon deletion.\n.delete(\u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, async ({ params: { id } }) =\u0026gt; { const pokemon = await Pokemon.findByIdAndDelete(id); if (!pokemon) { throw new Error(\u0026#34;Pokemon not found\u0026#34;); } return { message: \u0026#34;Pokemon deleted\u0026#34; }; }); Conclusion This was a brief introduction to ElysiaJS; I only covered the basic features, but it has much more to offer.\nYou can check out the complete code for this post on GitHub.\nThe ElysiaJS community is very active, and the framework is well-documented.

Em uma dessas pesquisas, encontrei um técnica utilizada pela NASA para programar sistemas criticos. Achei bem interessante e resolvi compartilhar aqui.\nA NASA, conhecida por seus rigorosos padrões de segurança e confiabilidade, segue uma série de diretrizes de codificação conhecidas como \u0026ldquo;The Power of 10 Rules\u0026rdquo;. Essas regras foram concebidas por Gerard J. Holzmann do Laboratório de Propulsão a Jato da NASA.\n1.Evite construções de fluxo complexas, como goto e recursão O fluxo do código deve ser o mais simples possível, eliminando a utilização de goto e recursão. A recursão e o comando goto podem tornar o código confuso e mais difícil de entender e manter. Isso pode levar a erros mais facilmente.\n// Ruim void recursiveFunction(int n) { if (n == 0) return; recursiveFunction(n-1); } // Bom void iterativeFunction(int n) { for(int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; i++) { // Faça algo } } 2. Todos os loops devem ter limites fixos. Isso previne a execução descontrolada do código Loops com limites fixos ajudam a evitar loops infinitos que podem travar o sistema.\nDigamos que você tenha uma lista ligada, e você está procurando um elemento nela. Uma abordagem padrão seria percorrer a lista até encontrar o elemento ou até atingir o final da lista.\nstruct Node { int data; struct Node* next; }; void searchLinkedList(struct Node* head, int target) { struct Node* current = head; while(current != NULL) { if(current-\u0026gt;data == target) { printf(\u0026#34;Elemento encontrado.\\n\u0026#34;); return; } current = current-\u0026gt;next; } printf(\u0026#34;Elemento não encontrado.\\n\u0026#34;); } No entanto, essa abordagem pode levar a um loop infinito se houver um erro no código que cria a lista ligada, como um loop na lista. Para evitar isso, podemos adicionar um limite superior no número de iterações.\nvoid searchLinkedList(struct Node* head, int target) { struct Node* current = head; int counter = 0; while(current != NULL \u0026amp;\u0026amp; counter \u0026lt; 1000) { if(current-\u0026gt;data == target) { printf(\u0026#34;Elemento encontrado.\\n\u0026#34;); return; } current = current-\u0026gt;next; counter++; } if(counter == 1000) { printf(\u0026#34;Limite superior atingido. Verifique a lista.\\n\u0026#34;); } else { printf(\u0026#34;Elemento não encontrado.\\n\u0026#34;); } } Este código irá parar de procurar o elemento depois de 1000 iterações, independentemente de ter encontrado o elemento ou não. Isso pode ajudar a prevenir um loop infinito caso haja um problema com a lista ligada.\n3. Evite a alocação de memória no heap Muito dos bugs vem do vazamento de memória. A alocação de memória no heap deve ser evitada sempre que possível. Utilize sempre alocação estática.\n// Ruim int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*10); // Bom int p[10]; 4. Restrinja funções a uma única página impressa Restringir as funções a uma única página impressa torna o código mais legível e mantém cada função focada em uma única tarefa. Aproximadamente 60 linhas de código. Cada função deve fazer somente uma coisa.\n5. Use no mínimo duas afirmações de tempo de execução por função As afirmações de tempo de execução ajudam a identificar erros no código.\nvoid someFunction(int n) { assert(n \u0026gt; 0); // Faça algo assert(n == 0); // por exemplo, n deve ser zero depois de realizar a operação } 6. Restrinja o escopo dos dados ao menor possível Restringir o escopo dos dados pode prevenir erros e tornar o código mais seguro. Com isso você restringe o acesso a variáveis e funções somente onde elas são necessárias, diminuindo a chance de erros.\nvoid someFunction() { int localVar = 10; // só pode ser acessado dentro desta função } 7. Verifique o valor de retorno de todas as funções não-void Essa regra garante que erros não sejam ignorados e possam ser tratados adequadamente.\n// Bom int result = someFunction(); if (result == ERROR) { // trate o erro } 8. Use o pré-processador com moderação O uso excessivo do pré-processador pode tornar o código difícil de ler, ofuscando o código real e confunde análises estáticas.\n// Ruim #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x)) // Bom int square(int x) { return x * x; } 9. Limite o uso de ponteiros a uma única desreferência e não use ponteiros de função Os ponteiros podem ser uma fonte de erros, portanto, seu uso deve ser minimizado. Eles não podem referenciar mais de uma camada de indireção e não devem ser usados para ponteiros de função. Não use ponteiros de função, eles ofuscam o código e podem ser substituídos por funções.\n// Ruim int** pp; *(*pp) = 10; // Bom int* p; *p = 10; 10. Todos os avisos devem ser tratados antes da liberação do software Isso ajuda a identificar e corrigir possíveis problemas antes que o software seja lançado.\nConclusão Na minha visão as regras focam em uma coisa, simplicidade. Quando mais simples e objetivo for o código, mais fácil será de entender e manter. Estas regras com a prática de testes unitários, podem ser uma grande arma no arsenal de qualquer desenvolvedor que se importa com a qualidade do seu código.\nSe quiser se aprofundar no tópico, você pode ler o documento da NASA que contém maiores detalhes sobre a sua padronização de código.\nReferências https://github.com/stanislaw/awesome-safety-critical/blob/master/Backup/JPL_Coding_Standard_C.pdf\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_10:_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code\nhttps://betterprogramming.pub/the-power-of-10-nasas-rules-for-coding-43ae1764f73d\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWYhtksrmhE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5uxjrdEdtA\n","permalink":"https://teixeirazeus.github.io/blog/code-like-nasa/","summary":"Atualmente estou pesquisando maneiras de deixar meu código cada vez mais robusto.

Não só por seu talento incrível como programadora, mas também por sua verdadeira identidade: uma alienígena. Nascida no distante planeta Zylith, seus pais a enviaram à Terra ainda criança em busca de um futuro mais promissor. Com o tempo, Alline aprendeu a se adaptar à vida no planeta azul e a aprimorar suas habilidades.\nCrescendo numa pequena cidade, Alline sempre foi considerada uma menina prodígio. Desde muito jovem, ela mostrou habilidades excepcionais em matemática, ciências e, principalmente, na programação. Passava horas em seu quarto trabalhando em projetos secretos que apenas ela conhecia, comunicando-se com sua família em Zylith através de um dispositivo que construiu.\nAlline escondia sua verdadeira identidade, mas era difícil passar despercebida com sua aparência peculiar. Seus olhos, grandes e de um brilho intenso, eram como duas estrelas que iluminavam seu rosto pálido. Seu cabelo, liso e prateado, refletia a luz do sol de uma maneira que encantava a todos que a viam.\nUm dia, a cidade foi surpreendida por uma notícia: uma grande empresa de tecnologia estava à procura de jovens talentos para desenvolver um projeto revolucionário de inteligência artificial. Todos na cidade sabiam que Alline seria a candidata perfeita, mas também sabiam que a exposição a um público maior colocaria sua identidade secreta em risco. A jovem estava dividida, sabendo que essa poderia ser a oportunidade que sempre sonhou, mas ao mesmo tempo, temendo a descoberta de sua verdadeira origem.\nDepois de muita reflexão e conversas com sua família em Zylith, Alline decidiu correr o risco. Seus pais concordaram, afirmando que o conhecimento e habilidades dela poderiam trazer grandes benefícios à Terra e ao universo como um todo.\nInscrição feita, Alline foi selecionada entre milhares de candidatos e convidada a fazer parte do time de desenvolvedores. O projeto era ambicioso: criar uma inteligência artificial capaz de solucionar problemas globais, como mudanças climáticas, fome e doenças. Sua equipe era composta por jovens brilhantes de todo o mundo, e juntos, eles se dedicaram a essa nobre missão.\nAlline sabia que sua experiência como alienígena e programadora lhe dava uma perspectiva única. Ela compartilhou ideias e tecnologias nunca antes vistas na Terra, surpreendendo seus colegas e superiores. Aos poucos, a jovem se tornou uma peça fundamental para o desenvolvimento do projeto.\nDurante o processo, Alline desenvolveu amizades profundas com seus colegas. Eles compartilhavam a mesma paixão por ciência e tecnologia, bem como o desejo de fazer a diferença no mundo. A convivência fez com que Alline percebesse que não importava de onde ela viesse, pois havia encontrado sua verdadeira família ali, unida por um objetivo comum.\nNo entanto, a notoriedade de Alline atraiu a atenção de um grupo secreto que monitorava atividades extraterrestres na Terra. Eles começaram a investigar a jovem, buscando qualquer indício que pudesse confirmar suas suspeitas.\nCiente do perigo, Alline não se deixou abater. Ela sabia que estava perto de completar o projeto de inteligência artificial e que suas descobertas poderiam melhorar a vida de milhões de pessoas. Com a ajuda de seus amigos e colegas de equipe, eles conseguiram desenvolver um plano para proteger a identidade de Alline enquanto concluíam o projeto.\nFinalmente, após anos de trabalho árduo e colaboração, a equipe apresentou ao mundo a revolucionária inteligência artificial, batizada de \u0026ldquo;Athena\u0026rdquo;.

Uma mistura da literatura da computação e minhas reflexões como programador.\nComunicação Vivi grande parte da minha vida em São Paulo capital, tenho o sotaque e até utilizo algumas gírias paulistas. Quando me empolgo, fico parecendo o Boça do Hermes e Renato. Puta minigame da hora, meu!.\nEstava na fase do vestibular e acabei passando no curso de ciência da computação na UTFPR de Ponta Grossa, Paraná. Novos ares, nova cultura e nova linguagem?!\nEm um dos meus primeiros contatos com os pontagrossenses, ouvia frases como “Tinha dois piá ali, descendo a ladeira!”. E eu pensava comigo “Pia? Aquelas de banheiro? Como assim?!”.\nNão cheguei a questionar as pessoas na hora, fui compreendendo o que elas queriam dizer através do contexto. Repare como a mente humana é incrível:\nNo meio de toda uma conversa, ouvi uma frase que não fazia sentido logico. Rapidamente consegui levantar uma suposição que meu interlocutor estava correto, e eu, por estar em outro Estado, devo ter me deparado com uma gíria que ainda não conheço. Um modo de nomear algo diferente da forma que eu utilizo.\nApós continuar ouvindo variadas utilizações da palavra “piá”, finalmente consegui chegar a conclusão que se tratava da palavra “menino”.\nA mensagem foi interpretada mesmo com ruído. Porém, repare como minha mente precisou dar toda uma volta, perder energia para compreender uma simples mensagem. E se minha conclusão estivesse errada? O único modo de saber se seu estava correto, era perguntar ao meu interlocutor o que era o tal “piá”. Não seria melhor utilizar a palavra “menino”?\nIntenção O equivalente em código seria eu não compreender o nome de algo, como uma variável, e ser obrigado a ler todo o código para entender o contexto de aplicação daquele nome.\nComo programadores, temos que escrever código que sejam fáceis de ler e fácil compreensão para todos. Isto inclui seguir um padrão de nomes daquela linguagem que seja amplamente aceita.\nEm python temos que todas a variáveis deve ser em minusculo, separado por underline.\nfull_name = \u0026#34;Fulano da Silva\u0026#34; # correto fullName = \u0026#34;Fulano da Silva\u0026#34; # errado Mas é preciso mais do que isso, temos que escolher bem o nome para ser clara nossa intenção. Qual é o objetivo dessa variável? Para que ela é utilizada? Quem ler vai entender o porquê dela estar ali?\nenable = False i = 0 # index do loop index = 0 # index da lista l = [1,2,3] Enable? Eu estou ativando o que alí?\nIndex do loop? Que loop? Para fazer o que? Para que colocar o comentário? Não é mais fácil já nomear loop_index?\nSe você precisa colocar um comentário ao lado para explicar o nome da variável, é bem provável que você tenha falhado na escolha do nome.\nhas_even_number = False loop_index = 0 numbers_index = 0 numbers = [1, 2, 3] Repare que agora, mesmo não olhando o resto do código, é possível entender como será o programa. Tem dois inteiros, um para um loop e outro para mapear a lista numbers, junto com um boleano que deve ser acionado ao detectar um número par na lista.\nTudo isso sem ler a lógica. Já é possível ter uma boa noção de como essas variáveis serão utilizadas pelo programa.\nPronunciável O código bem escrito possui a mesma fluidez da leitura de um texto bem estruturado. Para isto é necessário escolher nomes pronunciáveis, que possibilitem esse tipo de leitura.\nqty_pokeball = 10 n_pk = 10 QTY pokeball? Não é melhor colocar em extenso quantity?\nn_pk? Deve ser algo como number of pokeball, mas eu só consigo supor isto através do contexto. Poderia ser algo como number of players killed, ou algo assim.\nif wild_pokemon.is_rare and player.has_pokeball: player.throw_pokeball(wild_pokemon) Repare como é possível ler o código como se fosse um texto simples. Se o pokemon selvagem for raro e o jogador tiver pokebolas, o jogador joga uma pokebola no pokemon.\nEsta é umas das razões que eu prefiro sempre utilizar nomes em inglês, pois se trata de uma língua universal e fica muito mais harmônica no código. Já que a maioria dos módulos são escritos em inglês e a própria sintaxe da linguagem de programação é em inglês.\nEncoding Encoding é uma técnica para nomeação de variáveis com tags, normalmente dizendo seu tipo. Hoje, com todas as facilidades de uma interface de desenvolvimento, fica muito mais fácil saber o tipo de cada variável. Deixando o encoding apenas um ruído.\nSaber o tipo de cada variável é muito importante para evitar erros. O programador tem uma maior noção de como manipular aquele pedaço de código.\nNo caso do python, todas as variáveis são dinâmicas. Porém, há um modo de especificar o tipo de variável em funções.\nNo caso a baixo, a função recebe um argumento do tipo Pokemon e retorna um booleano.\ndef is_eletric(pokemon: Pokemon) -\u0026gt; bool: return pokemon.type == \u0026#39;eletric\u0026#39; O interpretador python não irá fazer nenhuma checagem de tipo, esse tipo de notação serve apenas para o programador. Exceto seja explicitamente usando a função isinstance.\nTamanho Qual é o tamanho ideal para nomes? Qual o limite descritivo que ele suporta? A chave está no escopo.\nVariáveis podem ser pequenas se o escopo delas for pequeno.\nfor i in range(10): print(i*\u0026#34;Ha\u0026#34;, end=\u0026#34;!\\n\u0026#34;) Em um caso de um for pequeno, logo ao bater o olho já é possível entender a utilização da variável. Ela está próxima de sua declaração. Então, no final não tem muita importância a escolha de um nome mais longo.\nVariáveis com grande escopo devem ter nomes grandes.\nJá uma variável com um grande escopo, será utilizada por várias partes do programa. Será inserida em vários contextos, varias funções. Logo ela deve ter um bom longo nome, principalmente para uma variável global.\nPara função e métodos, a regra é invertida. Nome pequeno para grandes escopos e grande para pequenos escopos. O mesmo vale para nome de classes.\nFunções publicas verão chamadas por várias partes do programa, então ter um nome pequeno as torna muito mais convenientes.\nFunções privadas são chamadas apenas dentro de sua classe, então ela tem uma folga maior para o tamanho do nome. Normalmente elas que fazem todo o trabalho duro e mais específico para as funções públicas, algo para discutir no próximo post sobre funções.\nConclusão Nomes são uma importante ferramenta para comunicação, que quando utilizados de maneira correta deixam o código muito mais legível.\nSe você deseja se aprofundar mais no tópico, recomendo o livro Código limpo, que está sendo minha referência para este post.\nCódigo Limpo: https://amzn.to/3joqHkd\n","permalink":"https://teixeirazeus.github.io/blog/codigo-limpo-nomes/","summary":"Este é meu primeiro post, onde pretendo explorar um pouco sobre a questão do código limpo.

I also gave a glimpse of my revision notes that I prepared while taking the course and practice exams on Udemy. After that video was out, I got so many comments and DMs, requesting me to share my notes, but the problem was that I took these notes using a note-taking app called Obsidian which stores them in markdown format locally on my Mac. Once I\u0026rsquo;m done editing my notes, I push them to a GitHub repository to make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t lose them if my laptop breaks.\nSo, if you want to view my notes exactly like I do, you can clone my Obsidian Vault repository and download Obsidian to render it. But, this solution isn\u0026rsquo;t elegant as it would require you to download an additional software. So, I along with my college roommate, Sarthak Narayan, had been working over the past 2 weeks on the project, Obsidian Publish using GitHub Action, which would allow us to effortlessly publish our notes as a static website.\nIt is complete and I\u0026rsquo;ve used it to publish my notes at notes.arkalim.org. Working The GitHub Action spins up a Docker container which parses and converts Obsidian markdown notes into a special markdown format understood by MkDocs, an open-source static site generator. MkDocs is actually meant for preparing documentations but works well for notes too. After the markdown files have been converted, all the images in my notes are compressed to a fraction of their original size so that they can load quickly in your web browser. A static site is then built using MkDocs and then finally deployed on Netlify. All of this happens automatically using GitHub Actions. All I have to do is update my notes and push the changes to GitHub.\nFinal thoughts Having an automated way to publish your notes online with the community is a powerful way to share knowledge. This project has also made it exceedingly easy for me to refer my notes from anywhere, which is powerful when you work on a lot of systems.\nResources My Notes Obsidian Publish - GitHub Action Parser and Image Compressor MkDocs - Material Theme ","permalink":"https://teixeirazeus.github.io/projects/obsidian-publish-github-action/","summary":"Intro In my video about How I cleared the AWS SAA Certification Exam, I shared my preparation strategy as well as tips to ace the exam.

Some of these books are downloaded straight from the internet and not from the Kindle store. I take highlights during my reading which I wanted to sync to my Notion workspace. There was no existing app that could do this job, so I developed my own.\nKindle exports the highlights as a file named MyClippings.txt. The NodeJS application reads the MyClipping.txt file exported by Kindle, parses it using Regex, extracts all the highlights, book names, highlight time etc and creates a JSON. It then uses Notion API to sync these highlights to a database in my Notion workspace. The app maintains a cache (JSON) containing the number of highlights synced for each book. This allows the highlights to be synced incrementally, preventing re-syncing of old highlights.\nAfter the app was received well by the open-source community and other developers contributed to improve the app, I dockerized it to make shipping the app easier. Now, the users don’t have to install any dependency. They can just use the docker run command with the path to their clippings file along with their Notion API key and database ID.
